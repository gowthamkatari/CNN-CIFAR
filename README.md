# CNN-CIFAR


This Project classifies an image to one of the 10 different labels. 
This is a deep learning model using convolution neural networks for classification
The model achieves 99% accuracy.

Dataset: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

Dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images. Image belong to 10 classes, with 6000 images per classs.
The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 
1000 randomly-selected images from each class. 
The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.
